<!-- excerpt: "About me"
-->

I am a third year Ph.D student at the [Department of Computer Sciences](https://cs.wisc.edu){:target="_blank"}, [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My interests are in the broad areas of weakly supervised learning and computational learning theory. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Manolis Vlatakis](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vlatakis/) with whom I work on problems at the intersection of learning theory and game theory.

Previously, I worked with the amazing [Prof. PS Sastry](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/sastry-p-s/){:target="_blank"} at the [Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://ee.iisc.ac.in) where my research was supported by the [Prime Minister's Research Fellowship](https://www.pmrf.in/). My work was on the problem of learning under _label noise_ and _adversarial noise_ with _deep neural nets_. This is also where I did my M.Tech (Research) (with [Prof. PS Sastry](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/sastry-p-s/){:target="_blank"} in the same department) and, as a part of my master's thesis, I worked on _robust supervised learning in the presence of label noise_.

Before that, I spent a year as a Project Assistant at [SPIRE Lab, IISc](https://spire.ee.iisc.ac.in/spire/){:target="_blank"} where I was advised by [Prof. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/prasanta-kumar-ghosh/){:target="_blank"} on speech-based automated disease onset detection and severity prediction of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's Disease.

Here is my [__Curriculum Vitae__](\files\deep-patel-cv.pdf){: .btn .btn--inverse}

Contact me at `dbp[dot]patel[dot]1994[at]gmail[dot]com` or `dbpatel5[at]wisc[dot]edu`.
<!--- I am also exploring the robustness properties of mammalian vision-inspired feedback mechanisms for deep neural networks. --->
