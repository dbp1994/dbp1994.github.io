This is an experiment. My plan is to document the summary of my attempts at improving my mathematical maturity. I will be keeping a log of topics/subjects that I am (or will be) studying for each period of 16 weeks (which is roughly one semester). These are topics/subjects which I am interested in and consider necessary for exceling at my research in Machine Learning.
