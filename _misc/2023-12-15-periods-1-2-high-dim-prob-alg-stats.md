I will document the summary of what I have been studying during Period-1 (16 weeks of Fall'23) and Period-2 (16 weeks of Spring'24). I primariy focused on algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics and high-dimensional probability, respectively.

# Period-1: Algorithmic Statistics
I took an amazing course recently by Prof. Ilias Diakonikolas on "Algorithmic High-Dimensional Robust Statistics". Below are links to my personal notes from his book and the class he taught.

- Lectures 1 to 3:
- Lectures 4 to 6:

# Period-2: High-Dimensional Probability
